# my little astral being
look after your own astral being, conveniently trapped into a physical form.

## ideas
~~all 'sub-species' are actually crystal types?~~
so I have a sprite of each animal as a crystalline being that then is just shaded differently?


start off with an egg (crystal) that's one of x colours where each colour then can be y different crystal types


~~each crystal type sets the base elements~~ which are then randomised slightly


the better you are at looking after your astral being, the quicker it is strong enough to escape its material form
