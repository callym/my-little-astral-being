# my little astral being
look after your own astral being, conveniently trapped into a physical form.

## ideas
~~all 'sub-species' are actually crystal types?~~
so I have a sprite of each animal as a crystalline being that then is just shaded differently?


start off with an egg (crystal) that's one of x colours where each colour then can be y different crystal types


~~each crystal type sets the base elements~~ which are then randomised slightly


the better you are at looking after your astral being, the quicker it is strong enough to escape its material form 

only use black and pastel colours

all interface is through a pie menu that appears when you click on your pet
